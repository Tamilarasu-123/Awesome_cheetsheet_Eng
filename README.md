## The Best Chinese Cheat Sheets

When I was learning Linux, I relied on a small card with common commands. If I forgot a command, I would often pick it up and take a look. Later, I learned that these are called "cheat sheets." So, I began to consciously collect and organize various cheat sheets for common programming languages, frameworks, and development tools. For many tools, reading books and lengthy articles can be time-consuming. Most of the time, you just need a compact table.

Recently, I was inspired by [LeCoupa's awesome-cheatsheets](https://github.com/LeCoupa/awesome-cheatsheets) project. I realized that there is a lack of high-quality Chinese resources online. This project aims to collect and organize cheat sheets for various programming languages, frameworks, and development tools. The goal is not quantity but quality, so that you can stop aimlessly searching the internet. A simple cheat sheet file should be sufficient.
